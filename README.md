# Super Sebastian World
### About
Super Sebastian World is a web-based 2D platform game based off of the iconic Super Mario Bros. game developed and published by Nintendo. This game was developed using the p5.js, p5.playjs, and scenemanger.js libraries. 
In Super Sebastian World, the player takes on the role of Sebastian the Ibis, the University of Miami official mascot, as he tries to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Mascoting.

### Tutorials
I walk through the process of making this game in my youtube series [#ucodeit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcAdnzko5SMj5f2GcgLaxBFRQIF3pqP5v). 
#### Part 1 
In PART I, I show you how to set up your p5 playground for development.
#### Part 2 
In PART II I show you how to set up the scenemanger that will enable the game to move through different scenes seamlessly.
